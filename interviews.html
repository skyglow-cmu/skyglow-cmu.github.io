              Dark Skies from the Other Side of the World
            </h5>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> When I interviewed Douglas Sprigg, the director of Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary in South Australia, it was early morning where I was on the East Coast of the United States. On the other side of the Earth, Mr. Sprigg was calling me after a night of observatory tours, when the darkness of the night sky was at its deepest. During the interview, he gave me a greater insight into the importance of dark skies as it relates to both the animals on his sanctuary as well as the humans that come to visit his observatories. </p>

            <p> Mr. Sprigg has had many wonderful experiences with star-filled skies, the earliest of which he remembers coming from the camping trips he took with his parents. Mr. Sprigg’s father, the previous director of Arkaroola, was a prolific geologist and scientist who would take his family on his outback travels. When he was seven years old, Mr. Sprigg was brought along on the first motorized crossing of the Simpson Desert, and he recounts “sleeping under the wonder and majesty of the celestial canopy.” He told me about how his own curiosity as a child towards the night sky is mirrored in the children that he sees on the astronomical observatory tours that he has run since 1986, and that dark skies are an essential part of nurturing scientific interest in young people, as “enquiring and challenging what we think we know is all part of science.”</p>

            <p> During our hour-long talk over FaceTime, Mr. Sprigg gave me a miniature observatory tour of my own, bringing me to a telescope in one of the four observatories open to the public at Arkaroola. Despite the poor connection and shaky video signal, he was still able to show me some beautiful images of the various celestial objects that are visible from Australia’s night sky. Through the telescope, we could see everything from Saturn and its distinctive tilted rings to the M57 Ring Nebula with its orange-red border born from nitrogen and sulfur. When I asked him about his favorite object to view in the night sky, he replied that he had a fondness for just about anything in space, and what he really loves was “seeing people suddenly get enthused about astronomy,” something that he gets to experience every time he brings someone up to the telescopes and shows them the beauty of binary stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies, and so on. As someone who has a deep love for astronomy myself, I was grateful for the opportunity to look through the telescopes, even as far away from the actual equipment as I was. </p>

            <p> Besides the up-close astronomical examination of the night sky that can be done with a telescope, there is also the overall impact of the dark sky on both humans and animals. There are many animals living in Arkaroola that would be negatively impacted by light pollution, like the yellow-footed rock wallabies, which are most active during the night. Mr. Sprigg showed me a picture of Cato, a rock wallaby that came to live with them for four months after an eagle attack, who is not only an adorable, wide-eyed, fluffy creature, but also an important reason to protect Australia’s dark skies. Where Mr. Sprigg lives, he says that he can often see stars down to magnitude 7 with the naked eye. He mentioned that the increased immigration to Australia’s urban areas, most of which are coastal, means that although the inland is more sparsely populated and light pollution is low by European and American standards, it is increasing as urban development continues. This could become problematic, as increased light pollution impacts Australia’s environment and makes it more difficult for people to enjoy the awe-inspiring and wonderful experience of clear dark skies. </p>

            <p> What I gained from this conversation was a deeper understanding of the importance of the dark skies, and how they are essential not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a communal one. Each generation’s continued love and fascination with what we can see in the night sky is essential to foster scientific growth for ages to come. </p>

              Light Pollution under the Lens: An Interview with Steven Miller
            </h5>
            

            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">

            </button>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> Today I spoke with Steven Miller on Zoom. Steven is a professional photographer and dark sky advocate in the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). He started out as a photographer, then later experienced his first dark sky while on a trip to Maine. Since then, he has been fascinated with photographing the night sky. </p>

            <p> Steven told me, “In the 200 years, we have taught ourselves not to look up at the night sky.” I myself am guilty of this, as are many other people I’m sure. It’s hard to blame us, really. I would have little idea of what a completely dark sky looks like without photographs like those taken by Steven.</p>

            <p> During our interview, Steven talked about ways to improve urban lighting, giving examples in his hometown of Orlando, FL. Shielding lights was an important consideration. He also talked about the process he goes through to take his stunning dark sky photos. </p>

            <p> Although I admittedly already knew a lot of the information he gave me about light pollution, I enjoyed listening to his enthusiasm for bringing back our dark skies. He showed me that you don’t need to have deep scientific knowledge to have an appreciation of dark skies. Steven screenshared with me PowerPoints that he had used at previous IDA events. He showed examples of poorly-designed and well-designed light fixtures. </p>

            <p> Since Steven lives in a highly urbanized area, he does not focus his activism on the dark skies themselves, but rather on better urban lighting practices that can both reduce light pollution and improve public safety.  </p>

            <p> According to Steven, the IDA is “not asking us to turn off all lights,” but rather, use lighting in a responsible way that reduces light pollution. To leave a parking lot completely dark, although it improves the dark sky, would obviously be “irresponsible.” However, he emphasized multiple times that nighttime spaces can also be too brightly lit. For example, he noted drivers who forget to turn on their headlights when exiting an over-lit parking lot, which could lead to more automobile accidents. He also used an example of the glare from a brightly lit gas station: “If your eyes are adjusted to the bright light under the gas station, would you be able to see a creepy guy running towards you from the dark?” </p>

            <p> One of the first things Steven showed me during the interview was a framed long-exposure dark sky photo from Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the nearest dark sky site to Orlando. It was his first dark sky photo. </p>

            <p> I was particularly amazed by the amount of effort he put in to take his dark sky photos. Firstly, he can only go out during the new moon. High humidity can also reduce visibility of stars. He has to stay up all through the night in an isolated campsite to take photos, sleeping until noon or 2 pm the next day. The camera exposure must also last 20 to 30 seconds—if there are humans in the picture, such as a wedding couple, they must stay still the whole time. </p>

            <p> One thing that struck me was how the long exposures emphasized the impact of light pollution on the night sky. In his photo at Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the light coming from a single rest stop formed a large band of orange glow across the horizon. At the extreme, a long-exposure photo of a downtown area is a complete whitewash, the entire sky obscured by skyglow. </p>

            <p> These long-exposure photos give a graphic representation of how significant the impact of light pollution is on wildlife and human health. With the naked eye, we can’t really “see” how artificial light drowns out the night sky. We just see a blank sky. But in Steven’s long-exposure photos, we can clearly see the orange glow on the horizon, drowning out the stars. (Or blue glow, in the case of some LEDs.) </p>

            <p> What if our naked eye saw light pollution in the same way Steven Miller’s camera lens sees it? Would we as humans be more committed to stopping light pollution? </p>

              A Sky Full of Stars, Meteors . . . and Light Pollution
            </h5>
            

            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> Until just recently, when the thought of light pollution came to mind, I did not associate it with much more than fading stars. I didn’t quite grasp how it may affect society in the future. However, after talking with Dr. Matthew Walker, a professor of astrophysics and cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University, I was able to recognize that light pollution could have negative effects on future generations. I realized that some of the wonderful night sky experiences shared with me by Dr. Walker may not be available to future generations if society continues to unnecessarily light up the night sky. </p>

            <p> In addition to being a professor, Dr. Walker is an observational astronomer, so, when asked about his experiences of looking up at the night sky, Dr. Walker was quick to share a number of astounding memories. One such experience was tied to the brightness of the Milky Way. “It’s quite a beautiful thing to see the structure of the Milky Way on a very dark night.” When walking down the side of a mountain in Chile on moonless night, Dr. Walker found that he was able to see his shadow as a result of the light being cast down by the Milky Way.</p>

            <p> A different story revealed not only a beautiful night sky object, but also what I interpreted as the sky’s sense of humor. When on a trip to Spain, Dr. Walker and a colleague visited what he called “the equivalent of a national park” after curfew to camp out under the stars. At one point, Dr. Walker and his colleague were alarmed by what seemed to be the flashing lights of police coming to reprimand the two for being out past curfew. White and red lights filled the sky, mimicking the lights of approaching police vehicles. However, Dr. Walker was surprised to find that the source of such light was not coming from law enforcement, but rather a meteor shining in the sky. While the two colleagues had visited the park to simply camp under the stars, the sky had other plans to inject a little humor into the night by briefly alarming the pair with illusions of authority figures. </p>

            <p> When hearing these amazing stories, I found myself yearning for experiences similar to those described by Dr. Walker. While I wish I could say that I have already experienced such marvelous astronomical events, I am excited by the future possibilities that lay in front of me. However, with such excitement comes a more complete understanding of the light pollution problem. While I have not yet seen the Milky Way in person or had run-ins with the cosmic police force, I know that I could travel to another part of the world and experience wonderful night sky events. However, this may not be true for future generations. Such generations may not have their desire to see the night sky become a reality if the sky continues to be polluted by light. </p>

            <p> Additionally, Dr. Walker shared an event that further impressed the problem of light pollution on me. Dr. Walker conducts research at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. According to him, the Las Campanas Observatory is “what’s widely regarded as the best so-called natural seeing of any observatory.” However, he stated that about ten years ago, the Chilean government funded the widening of the Pan-American Highway. The lighting of this highway can be seen from the observatory and has been negatively affecting the research of those taking astronomical photographs from the observatory. One of the best places for viewing the night sky is being affected by light pollution. Considering this fact, I think it is the perfect sign for those unaware of the gravity of light pollution to understand the significance of the problem.  </p>

            <p> When talking to Dr. Walker about light pollution, he shared a valuable sentiment. “As someone who appreciates the night sky I view it as a kind of birthright that humans have always enjoyed throughout all of humanity . . . and I think it’s just a terrible shame that we are, without thinking about it, degrading the quality of that view for ourselves and for future generations.” Without knowing, we as a society are often putting the night sky at risk. Considering this, I have found it increasingly important to raise awareness about the effects of light pollution so that we can take control of our decisions and combat any unintentional actions with actions of positive resolve and purpose. </p>

            <p> Deep within the mysterious Chilean mountains hides some of the darkest skies on Earth. The Milky Way stretches from horizon to horizon with thousands of stars, bright enough to cast a ghostly shadow. In this overwhelmingly unfamiliar silence, the mechanical eye’s lens opens wide to capture a stunning sight few will experience in their lifetimes. </p>

            <p> Matthew Dieterich is the man behind this camera. I had the pleasure of interviewing him to learn about his journey into photography. You may recognize his iconic photo of the northern lights above Mount Rainier, part of a 2016 United States Postal Service limited edition <a href="https://www.mdieterichphoto.com/stamp" target="_blank"> Forever Stamp print. </a></p>

            <p> An astrophotographer with a background in geology, his mission is to bring this dark sky experience to people through a variety of hands-on workshops. At the same time, he works for PlaneWave Instruments, on the road for much of the year installing observatory gear across the globe. </p>

            <p> Astrophotography involves a knowledgeable mix between mechanical, the camera, and digital worlds. Matt says his fascination with the stars as a child is what initially drew him to perfecting these images. He wanted a challenging, hands-on activity that not everybody was already familiar with. And so, he invested in emerging technologies and learned the interactions within software to document beautiful visuals.</p>

            <p> Matt pursued an education around environmental science, chemistry, and eventually focused on geology. Geology is not a typical pathway into an astronomy-related career but gave way to a multitude of opportunities to experience the dark sky. In 2015, Matt started working in a program for geologists in partnership with the National Parks Service. That summer, he spent time at Mount Rainier National Park as an Astronomy Education Ranger, teaching visitors about the night sky and astrophotography skills. He explains that it was “one of the best summers” and that he would love to “live under those kinds of skies.” While working there, he met visitors of all backgrounds who were there to experience a world invisible in cities.   </p>

            <p> Many people either do not have the ability or lack the desire to seek out opportunities to see the natural sky untarnished by light pollution. But you do not have to go to Chile or the National Parks to see more stars. Matt suggests finding a mentor or buddy with some astronomy interest to take you out to a dark sky. Local astronomy clubs are present throughout the world and often host star parties or informational sessions that are open to the public. For those seeking more experience-based learning, Matt offers guided workshops about the capturing and post-processing of night photos or time-lapsed images. These workshops allow you to “get under good, dark skies to connect to it and take some cool photos along the way.” You can keep up with updates on these workshops and the photos Matt takes on his Instagram (handle mattdieterich).  </p>

            <p> Observing the night sky is fundamental to our being and most, once able to truly see it, are drawn by its wonder. Matt realized that “we’re so connected through the night sky” and that it transcends our differences. </p>

            <p> Have you ever seen the Milky Way? Today, more than 80 percent of the world's population lives under skyglow—the phenomenon where artificial light illuminates the night sky and overwhelms natural light from space. Among them, I have never experienced a truly dark night where one can see thousands of stars with naked eyes. </p>

            <p> Ken Walczak works at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago as the Senior Manager for <i> Far Horizons </i>, a program that brings experiments designed and built by students, volunteers, and the public to the stratosphere, the edge of earth's atmosphere, with high altitude balloons.</p>

            <p> Ken recounts his first experience under a truly dark night sky. What does the Milky Way look like? Imagine you are driving in the middle of nowhere. The sun is setting, you checked the weather: clear. You get all excited just to be disappointed by clouds coming at you. Well, you say to yourself, better luck next time. But yet, "What I thought were clouds was actually the Milky Way. It was so bright that it looks like a giant cloud across the sky. I literally pulled over to the side of the highway… I was amazed by how dark the night sky could be, how bright the stars could be." </p>

            <p> Ken grew up in a suburb south of Chicago where the southern night sky is still dark, but skyglow from downtown creeps in from the north. Like any child passionate about astronomy, he read books about the universe and observed celestial bodies in the night sky—the latter, unfortunately, has become almost impossible for most children nowadays. Ken told me what the universe meant to him. "The universe brings this giant, endless horizon to your world... In one sense, compared to the universe, a single human being is infinitesimal; but compared to the rarity life as we know it... it makes you also feel incredibly unique." People might think of the universe differently, but today we don't even "know" the universe is there. Light pollution not only wastes energy, disrupts our sleep, and endangers ecosystems—it also takes away who we are.</p>

            <p> Fortunately, many people are striving to bring dark skies back, and Ken is one of them. 100 missions of Far Horizons have reached the stratosphere, one of which is NITELite. Previously, light pollution data was collected with either airplanes or satellites. NITELite filled in the height gap by using high altitude balloons to take high resolution photos of nighttime Chicago from a unique vantage point at a much lower cost. It turned out to be a great success.  NITELite recorded detailed data before and after streetlights in Chicago were switched to LEDs. This data helps policymakers make better decisions on lighting to reduce light pollution. </p>

            <p> Among all forms of pollution, light pollution is extremely easy to eliminate: flip the switch, shield the light and use the right color and brightness—that's all it takes to bring the Milky Way back. The greatest obstacle, as Ken emphasized a lot, is awareness. "Most people are not aware that light pollution is even a thing... The first thing we need to do is education." Before asking someone to turn off their lights, they need to realize that excessive lighting disrupts their sleep cycles and could make it harder, not easier, to see at night. Ken is working with Northwestern University to try to build an exemplary, ideally lit district in Chicago that not only has a lower electricity bill but also is more pleasant to live in. If it proves to be a success, this would give a great boost to the public’s awareness of light pollution and encourage more places to follow this example. </p>

              An Unexpected Journey to Light Pollution Research
            </h5>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> In an interview with Andrea Giacomelli, a light pollution researcher in Italy, I discovered the interesting path that he took to light pollution research. His journey began when he studied environmental engineering in college. Society had little concept of pollution decades ago, so his major combined math, sciences and computer science, a combination that would come become useful later in his life. </p>

            <p> Andrea’s graduate school dissertation was in graphic information systems (GIS), which is basically, as he put it, entering maps into a computer.  While completing his dissertation, he had the opportunity to study in Belgium, where his tutor advised him to go for his Ph.D. It was a good plan, so off he went to Milano to complete his Ph.D. with a paper in hydraulic engineering. Andrea pointed out the similarities between hydraulic engineering and light pollution as being . . . nothing.</p>

            <p> In Italy, students are granted six months to go abroad and study. Most students in Europe choose to go to the U.S., however, Andrea was unable to as he was waiting for his military service to end. It was not practical for him to study across the ocean, in case he got called to Italy. Because of this, he did his six months on the island of Sardinia. He described it as, “administratively part of Italy, but really its own planet.” After his time in Sardinia, he returned to Milano and began sending resumes around to environmental agencies, but another opportunity arrived in the form of a call from his tutor in Sardinia saying there was a position open in GIS. His five years in Sardinia was special because it was Andrea’s first time working in a rural setting. He noted that the skies were much darker there than in Milano, and he was able to see the stars very well. He began to consider the rural area from southern Tuscany as the Wild West.  His grandfather lived in these areas and was pretty much a cowboy. </p>

            <p> He decided that he wanted to do something meaningful and productive in these Wild West regions of Italy. In 2008, he started a project to try and get the common person more aware light pollution and the fight against it. At the time the project started, light pollution was a known issue mainly to the experts. The first people that raised the issue of light pollution were those looking up to the sky, the astronomers. The general public really did not know anything about light pollution and its effects. Andrea felt the best way to get people involved was to take a sensor, the sky quality meter, which allows anyone to take a measurement of the darkness of the sky.  </p>

            <p> His initiative was at first considered curious and fun. In fact, his project was featured in an Italian Mickey Mouse magazine. Now, over ten years later, Andrea is giving lectures in the university setting about the same topics. In ten years, the project turned from something geeky and strange into something that now counts towards university credits.</p>

            <p> Andrea stated that astronomers were the last people that should be relied on do something about light pollution. Their training is looking at the sky, not seeing what is happening on the ground. As an environmental engineer, trained in many disciplines, he can put together different experts in order to tackle light pollution. He feels that light pollution cannot be approached by one expert who feels they know everything. Light pollution has a “kaleidoscopic effect,” and therefore you must collect data from all kinds of backgrounds. He has found his education has allowed him to be a skilled mediator in his project. </p>

            <p> To conclude, I asked where Andrea sees the public’s understanding of light pollution going within a few years.  It will take people time to care about light pollution. Just think how long it took people to realize riding a bike to work is better than taking a car. He stated that society is difficult to change. </p>

              Speaking Stars with Dr. Siska de Baerdemaeker: a unique perspective
            </h5>
            

            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> Approximately 4000 miles away from where I am currently located lives a short-haired, passionate scientist. In the brief half hour that we spoke, the animated tone with which Dr. Siska spoke was extremely visible—even though we were miles apart. When I asked her why she first became interested in cosmology, her eyes shone as she replied with, “There is a childlike excitement that I genuinely have about studying the universe… the stars and the night sky just speak to your fascination because it looks so unfamiliar to us.” She further elaborates on a more intellectual note by asking “How is it possible that science can teach us so much about the world around us? I think the challenges that cosmology currently faces are sort of pushing that question to its limits.” We go on to discuss how abstract the whole field is and how areas in cosmology and astrophysics such as dark matter are unlike anything we’ve studied on Earth before.  </p>

            <p> Reflecting back on our conversation, I realized how wrapped up in our own lives we are and how we never stop to entertain our curiosity and ponder why is the universe the way that it is. What happened before the Big Bang? What’s inside a black hole? There are so many unanswered questions that haunt scientists. Dr. Siska’s current research has to do with the philosophical underpinnings of cosmology and astrophysics as a scientific discipline. She describes the premise of her work being that cosmologists follow an unorthodox method to scientific discovery as compared to the typical scientific method that most other fields use. She described the difference between cosmologists and other scientists by stating “Cosmologists are constructing this model of our 13.8-billion-year-old universe and they think they have a pretty good grasp on it, but that’s kind of surprising given the fact that the universe is so big. There’s only one of it and we can’t really put it in a lab. We can only look at it from our Earth.” Dr. Siska studies the unique techniques astronomers and cosmologists use and attempts to answer questions like what makes cosmologists able to create knowledge about the evolution of the universe and how do cosmologists go about their experiments and observations?</p>

            <p> While Dr. Siska isn’t a cosmologist herself (her doctorate is from the University of Pittsburgh’s History and Philosophy of Science Department, one of the highest regarded such departments in the world), she has a passion for the field and loves to immerse herself in the brilliant breakthroughs cosmologists make. Unfortunately, a huge barrier to observational cosmology is light pollution, which was relatively severe in Belgium where Dr. Siska grew up. When she moved to the US, she saw her first clear night sky and remarked how it, “made me realize I missed out on a lot of stars when I was younger. It’s a humbling experience. The other thing is that it made me very excited for the physics research that’s happening. It shows you how much more is happening and how much there is to be done, which made me really excited.” We also conversed about her experiences stargazing, although few, she hopes to do more in the future.  </p>

            <p> While speaking at an event at Allegheny Observatory, Dr. Siska observed a double star and the Moon which she stated, “Seems like one of the least spectacular things you can do, but it was actually incredibly cool to look at the Moon up close,” primarily because of the history behind it and how being able to look at the Moon through a telescope was a huge thing when you’re just starting out to learn what is out there in the universe.  </p>

            <p> Even though there is so much yet to discover in the universe, light pollution is becoming a greater and greater obstacle, sometimes forcing astronomers to flee to more remote locations to observe the universe. When discussing light pollution Dr. Siska noted that “If you’re interested in cosmological and astrophysical observations, you obviously want to make sure they can happen in the best possible circumstances and light pollution is going to be a big challenge to that. So, bringing light pollution under attention and creating awareness is a small way that I can also contribute to successful cosmological practice.” To see the stars shine down on us again and answer burning questions about the universe, we must address light pollution in our communities—for the advancement of science. </p>

            <p> After my enlightening conversation with Dr. Siska, it’s like a Pandora’s box has been opened in my mind with questions about the universe. The mystery and allure of the unknown attracts scientists of all over the world who are trying to understand our place in the greater context. Questions that will never be answered if our looking glass is clouded with extra light. </p>

              Looking to the Stars: The Call for Dark Sky Parks
            </h5>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> As of January 15, 2020, Dr. T.K. Lawless Park in Cass County, Michigan, is one of the latest parks to have received IDA Dark Sky Park recognition, in large part thanks to Robert Parrish, Cass County Parks Board Commissioner and dark sky advocate. </p>

            <p> Parrish is a member of the Michiana Astronomical Society and an amateur astrophotographer who can trace his fascination with the heavens back to his childhood. Parrish was largely inspired by his father, who was in the Navy. He recalled that his father “worked with a lot of Naval pilots, and the pilots used to have to navigate by the stars at night. So, he picked up different things from them and taught me what he had learned. I grew up in the age of the space race in the 1960s, so between my dad and the space race, I was hooked.” From his backyard in southwest Michigan, he could see the Milky Way arching across the sky with a telescope he had gotten for Christmas; but now, light pollution has made this impossible almost everywhere, with dark sky preserves like Lawless Park providing a sanctuary for those who love looking up at the stars.</p>

            <p> Gaining IDA dark sky status was not an easy feat. It was a process that took Parrish two and a half years, and a 66-page application. The park’s lighting needed to be overhauled; bright mercury vapor and halogen lights were replaced with IDA-compliant LEDs. Yet Parrish remarked that public outreach and community involvement was the majority of the work of becoming a dark sky park. Parrish hosted presentations detailing the adverse effects of light pollution in the greater Michigan-Indiana area, educating others about what they could do to help preserve dark skies.</p>

            <p> Initially, many members of the community had misconceptions about dark sky friendly lighting, believing that brighter lights would provide safety against crime, and that dark sky friendly lighting would be dangerous. Yet once the changes were implemented in Lawless Park, many were pleasantly surprised. The ground was well-lit and fully visible, while the sky was dark, benefitting not only park-goers but also local wildlife. Furthermore, energy-efficient LEDs soon pay for themselves by saving money on electricity. Due to the success of Lawless Park, Cass County is considering replacing lights at other parks with cool temperature LEDs as well. </p>

            <p> As light pollution pervades nearly every part of America, parks across the country have begun to welcome dark sky tourism. Recently, Michigan embraced dark sky tourism as part of their Pure Michigan ad campaign, airing advertisements promoting the beautiful, clear skies that can be seen across the state in eight dark sky preserves. 80% of Americans cannot see the Milky Way, and preserves allow people to once more experience the beauty of the cosmos. For Parrish, looking at the stars is a spiritual experience. “No matter your opinion, we’re all made of star stuff. And when you’re looking at the stars, you’re really looking at your origins, at humanity’s origins.”</p>

            <p> Parrish dedicated the park’s newly-earned dark sky status as a tribute to his father’s memory. He recalls sitting outside under the stars with his father who would say, No matter what your troubles are, sitting underneath a beautiful starry sky, you forget about them. Thanks to Parrish, many will be able to enjoy the beauty of the dark night sky at Lawless Park.</p>

              An Interview with Bettymaya Foott; Stargazer and Trailblazer
            </h5>

            <p> By day, Bettymaya Foott is the Director of Engagement for the International Dark-Sky Association, helping to raise awareness and lay the foundations for the growth of a field that is beginning to truly take off. By night, Bettymaya doubles as an astrophotographer, capturing breath-taking images of nightscapes across the world. Her work features across an array of formats, from museum exhibits at the National History Museum of Utah to publications such as National Geographic and the Los Angeles Times. This week I was lucky enough to talk to her about everything from her dream collaborator to the most pressing issues facing the IDA today. As a relative novice to the field of astronomy and dark-skies, I was really keen to talk to someone who could project a beating passion for this area and express why this was so important to them. </p>

            <p> Bettymaya developed her love for stars and dark skies from a young age. Growing up in Moab, Utah, Bettymaya spent summer nights stargazing from her trampoline.  Her passion continued throughout her academic career as she completed a degree in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. It was during this time that some of the challenges facing dark-skies truly became clear to her. After moving from the idyllic Moab to the hustle and bustle of Salt Lake City, one of the first things Bettymaya noticed was the relative blandness of the urban sky. Since then, Bettymaya has been leading the charge to raise awareness and support research to help preserve the world’s fading dark-skies.</p>

            <p> Bettymaya also gave me an insight into what inspires her work as an astrophotographer, and how despite all the world’s wonders she has already captured, she still has an insatiable appetite to discover more. I asked her to picture a helicopter appearing suddenly outside her door - if it could take her anywhere in the world, where might she go? Armed with her camera, Bettymaya told me she dreams of visiting the Himalayas to witness its Airglow, a natural phenomenon where the Earth’s atmosphere appears to emit its own faint source of light.</p>
            <div class="text-center">

              Airglow in Tibet, Image by Jeff Dai</a>
            </div> </br>

            <p> There was a palpable sense of excitement and adventure after I asked Bettymaya who her dream collaborator would be; she replied that she would love to once more work with astrophotographer Sergio Montúfar. Together they embarked on an adventure across his native Guatemala, shooting its stunning ancient Mayan temples across a backdrop of pure dark-skies. </p>

            <p> Unfortunately for Bettymaya and the rest of the Dark-Sky community, problems like ‘Skyglow’, where the night sky is illuminated by artificial sources, are rapidly contributing to their recession. The main reasons for this, as Bettymaya explains, are the combination of increasing urban sprawl and the prevalence of poorly designed and unshielded lights. Urban sprawl is somewhat inevitable as countries’ economies grow and continue to invest in their developing cities; on the other hand, the misuse of light is a much simpler problem to solve. Streetlamps are often poorly designed and are a main contributor to Skyglow; instead of brightening only the street below, they typically bleed outwards and illuminate the sky. In theory, LEDs chould solve this problem as they can be easily directed and controlled. However, poor planning and design leads too often to more unnecessary illumination of the surrounding area. A key lesson for city planners to learn is to become aware of this and choose fully sustainable products. Bettymaya was keen to stress the need to be aware of this regardless of location; whether one is installing lights in a major city or in the middle of nowhere, this bleeding effect can have severely detrimental impacts on our surroundings. The best way to prevent this is to ensure that a light installation meets three key criteria: the light is shielded, uses warmer colors and is not too intense.</p>

            <p> Looking ahead, Bettymaya continues to strive towards raising awareness for the protection of our fleeting Dark-Skies. She proposed that one of the most effective ways to do this is to join the International Dark-Sky Association’s Advocate Network. By becoming an IDA Delegate, volunteers can become the face of the IDA in their local communities and provide a platform for them to continue spreading their impact.</p>

            <i> An interview with Ms. Stephanie Fall. </br>
            A story to Stephanie, to myself, and to everyone who dreams about the universe.
            </i> </br></br>
            <p> I interviewed Stephanie Fall, a wife, mother, grandmother and star lover. She grew up in the days when the television was not the prime center of life. As a little girl living in Upstate New York, she was rarely inside the house. Her childhood flew by in the woods and the plateau across the street, her fingertips played with shrubs and dipped in the water of streams. Looking up into the sky, she saw the clouds and imagined what shapes they made. The nights didn’t seem scary to her as it does now to many children in cities. She often brought her astronomy kits and went outside with her friends. The little astronomers spent hours and hours looking at the stars—the Big Dipper, Orion’s Belt and Polaris, the Pole Star. She told me, “There were stars, from what I’ve seen, there were lots, and lots of stars.” The wonderful night journey interested her in an earth science class where she learned a lot was about the sky. </p>

            <p> Some people say that adult life is all about grey, not black, not white. Adults naturally are aware that happiness often comes with the suffering. They are free to love, but also feel bound sometimes. Stephanie said. “I was working all the time and I was traveling all the time. I couldn’t focus on anything other than my children, my husband, and my job.” Adults take some breaks from jobs occasionally, as Stephanie and her husband did fifteen years ago, taking a three-week trip to the Southwest. Amazing things happened out of blue. Stephanie and her husband visited one of their friends who lived in a cabin at the top of a mountain in Taos, NM. “His house was very remote, and there was no light at all,” Stephanie said. “After dinner, my friend said, ‘Let me show you something’ and we went outside. I thought he was going to show us his horses, but instead he said, ‘Look up.’” Stephanie stopped speaking for a moment, as if remembering. “We’ve never seen anything like that.”</p>

            <p> She saw the sky—the most beautiful, unbelievable sky she has ever seen in her life. “Really, it looked like there were more stars than empty space. It was like you were under a canopy of lights and it was so shocking… I can’t describe it, but I am trying to describe it to you.” At that moment, I saw all kinds of emotions flowing across her face. I saw stars shining in her eyes, and I could plainly see that she felt the love of the sky. </p>

            <p> The sky loves us in such a special way that once we feel it, we never forget. The memory stays—our first astronomy kits, constellation graph and the first time to see those amazing stars, but sometimes, we feel sad because the memory is not the current reality as people rarely see stars nowadays. “I had a feeling that my grandchildren would rather look at them [the stars] on the computer instead of going outside because there aren’t many of them in the sky. It’s been almost 60 years.” Stephanie misses the old days, especially when she sees an empty city night sky with too many artificial lights. She moved to a remote, woody area outside of Pittsburgh with her husband. Their grandchildren go visit them quite often. “They are just so fascinated that we have streams, we have woods, and they love it so much…it’s too bad that they don’t have these things in their everyday life.” </p>

            <p> The reminiscence is for people who have experienced the wonders. The first generation born under an empty sky still hear stories from their parents and their grandparents. After generations of empty skies, those stories will become legends. “For people in my neighborhood, they knew how amazing the sky was, they knew the lights were affecting the wildlife and their planets, but for a lot of people, they don’t think about that…[because] their life isn’t affected.” Just as the adult life is never absolutely black or white, human desires and ambitions cultivate civilization, but also bring in greediness, exaggeration and exploitation. We have been living on the edge and have almost forgot humbleness and respectfulness, the qualities our ancestors formed every time when they looked up, realizing that they would probably never touch the dim of the sky. Some people say natural disasters or pandemics like COVID-19 are the revenge of nature, but I would rather believe they’re the love of the universe. Confronting the disasters, humanity becomes more conscious, scared, and respectful. “One of my sons lives next to a very big park [with his family]. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, he got time to take his kids into the park on a daily basis, for two and a half hours. He told my 4-year-old grandson about the stars, the Earth and the other planets. It’s terrific that the education he just gets is from nature.”</p>

            <p> Stephanie is now retired, retired with bold dreams and wonders, retired as a new beginning of her life. The first thing she did after retirement was to sign up for an astronomy class. “The class was different than I thought. It was much more interesting and there were many things I didn’t know. The things I learned in a couple of hours a week were incredible to me. I am very fortunate to have had the time and opportunity.” </p>

            <p> The sky loves Stephanie. It opened up all her curiosities in her childhood. It moved her, surprised her and shocked her with thousands of stars during her adulthood. The sky enlightened her to the boundless possibilities in the universe and brought her courage, joy and humbleness. “It’s like a shock when you look up and see how minutely tiny we are… the things we are worried about are so insignificant… I look at those [stars], and say, I had my little time on Earth, what I’m trying to do is just to enjoy the little bit time in my life, to see how tiny we are, and how short our life is. That’s been my focus.</p>

              Dr. John’s Passion for Astronomy
            </h5>

            <p> I had the pleasure of being inspired in the field of astronomy by Dr John Wenskovitch, Visiting Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech University. We had a thirty-minute zoom video call across two continents, Asia and North America.</p>

            <p> Dr. John’s interest in astronomy started at the age of six when he got a general book about astronomy as a Christmas present. Reading about the universe—stars, planets, galaxies—turned out to be a fascinating experience for him, and he has been hooked ever since. Although he is curious about a lot of sciences, like physics, chemistry and computer science, astronomy has always been his first love. </p>

            <p> Nine years ago, he bought a telescope to get into observational astronomy. This has led to even more appreciation of astronomy and a realization of how hard the field is. Dr. John states, “To look at the stars and galaxies, and extrapolate the rotational dynamics and other characteristics of these objects is a phenomenal task.” On numerous occasions he has set up a telescope in a park and inspired people by showing them mountains and craters on the moon, or galaxies. He told me, “Looking at the reactions of people is priceless, and it motivates me even more to have greater outreach and amaze people with the beauty of the universe.”</p>

            <p>We discussed light pollution. Dr. John has noticed the difference in the night sky — from seeing a hundred stars in the city, to thousands of stars, star clusters and galaxies in the suburbs. He points out that people might not think of this as a big problem because of the gradual change in the sky at the same location. People can clearly see the difference when they change sites, but the difference in the sky from the same place is not fast. </p>

            <p> To motivate people to consider light pollution as a serious issue, he suggests there has to be public pressure. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is trying to do this by persuading governmental agents in cities to change their lighting regulations. The IDA also makes them aware of the problems to the environment caused by light pollution like the migratory behavior of birds. Furthermore, cities will save money by changing lighting patterns because the light would be focused on one area instead of spreading everywhere. This leads to lower power consumption and better focus on the lighting on the streets.</p>

            <p> Dr. John fears that in the coming years, we might make the planet so bright that we will lose the concept of a dark sky completely. To prevent this from happening, he suggests, “We need to go to places and show people the star fields and galaxies through telescopes. We have to inform people that we didn’t need a telescope 150 years ago to look at this.” </p>

            <p> Dr. John further recommends that we have to make the problem less abstract and convince people by showing them how their lives have been affected by light pollution. We are changing the evolutionary patterns humans have been following for the last many thousands of years. Even though electricity was invented in the previous 150 years, artificial light at night is still a swift change that is biologically affecting us. We are adapting to it slowly as compared to the technological advances. Our interview ended with his thoughts on an incremental regulatory plan that would allow more people to see dark skies.</p>

            <p> Louis Coban manages Allegheny Observatory, which is eight miles northwest of CMU. Lou has been working at the observatory for over twenty-five years and “does a little bit of everything” ranging from giving tours and fielding press interviews to operating the telescopes. His interest in astronomy and the night sky began at a young age when he received a telescope as a Christmas present. This exciting new gift, combined with the multitude of fascinating astronomy programs on many cable channels, piqued his interest. He soaked up information from these documentaries “like a sponge.”</p>

            <p> Lou enjoys his current job, but his favorite part is being able to interact with the three observatory telescopes. I know a tiny bit about optics and was pretty curious about the differences and similarities between these telescopes. He was happy to elaborate and explain in more detail. </p>

            <p> The “Fitz-Clark Refractor” is a thirteen-inch telescope that is over a century old. It was brought over from the original Allegheny Observatory located a few miles closer to town and declared to be, “forever free to the people.” It is old school and can be run with no technology associated with it; as a result, it is nowadays primarily used on weekly public tours, April through October, and Monday through Thursday for University of Pittsburgh students who visit as part of their introductory astronomy class. The thirty-inch refracting telescope, named the “Thaw Refractor," was automated by Lou to be capable of being run wirelessly from a warm room. It has a weight of approximately eight thousand pounds with a focal length of forty-seven feet. Currently it is set up for astrometry, the study of the position of stars. The third white observatory dome houses a 16-inch reflecting telescope that has also been automated, so Pitt students can operate it remotely from campus. The STEPUP group is working on a project to confirm Kepler Satellite exoplanet candidates.</p>

            <p>Being as involved in astronomy as Lou is, he has experienced some fantastic views of the night sky. He recalls some particularly memorable moments. The first involved the Milky Way Galaxy. He was visiting a friend who lives on a farm near Albion, a town in northern Pennsylvania with very little pollution and thus clear views. He describes his first time viewing the galaxy as having this “really amazing view.”</p>

            <p> Around three years after he started working at the observatory, he traveled to the Keck Observatory in Hawaii to use the Keck 2 telescope for astrometry, which is a way of measuring distances to other stars.</p>

            <p> Lou also saw an aurora at the Allegheny Observatory around fifteen years ago. Aurora are seen when charged particles from the Sun come into the atmosphere of the Earth at the poles. He described the lights as “green and red curtains” that expanded into the sky and formed right overhead, blanketing the night sky in vivid colors. The scale and intensity of it was something that cannot be forgotten.</p>

            <p> We moved on to talking about the night sky in Pittsburgh. Lou said that autumn is the best season for viewing since the nights are becoming longer and the weather is usually clearer than other seasons. One downside is that Pittsburgh is also relatively close to the Great Lakes, which can hinder visibility due to cloud formation from condensation. As the President of the Amateur Astronomers Association of Pittsburgh, Lou oversees two other local observatories, <a href="http://www.3ap.org" target="_blank"> Mingo and Wagman </a> and about 500 active members who try to observe every time the weather permits.</p>

            <p> I found our conversation to be informative and enlightening. I have never really been into astronomy but signing up for this class and being able to speak with someone who has a lot of experience in the field has really opened my eyes. I am definitely interested in learning more about stars, space and astronomy in general. I am hoping that with this knowledge, the next time that I go stargazing with friends, I will be able to fully appreciate seeing a clear night sky in person, point out some constellations, and educate others.</p>

             Orders of Magnitude: The Significance of Astronomy through Dr. Rachel Bezanson
            </h5>
            

            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">

            <p> A blanket of stars overwhelmed the sky, scattering far past the horizon. Appearing white and twinkly, they acted as a foil to the explosive trail of the Milky Way that lead to the peak of a distant mountain. This was the average night’s view from the deck of Rachel’s childhood home in “the Middle of Nowhere, Colorado.”</p>

            <p> “I probably just took it for granted,” Rachel—now Dr. Bezanson— reflects. I am interviewing Dr. Bezanson, observational astronomer at the University of Pittsburgh, over Zoom—she has just woken up while I’m across the world, already hours into the night. I peer out my own balcony doors, staring into glaring lights permeating through thousands of windows, bespeckling a blank navy umbrella above; these are the stars of Singapore’s skies.</p>

            <p> I grew up thinking pictures of real starry skies were fabricated because I simply couldn’t imagine it; it’s difficult to comprehend that Rachel had grown up able to take those pictures every night. It evokes a sense of nostalgia for something I had never experienced.</p>

            <p>“It wasn’t like I always knew I was going to be an astronomer,” Rachel continues. While night-sky visibility has significantly decreased over the years, seeing the Milky Way every night wasn’t something she thought about very much while growing up, although she did love the view. “Like, if you’re used to seeing streetlights, you just get used to streetlights.” In college, pre-med Rachel decided to take an introductory astronomy for non-majors course on a whim . . . and she fell in love. Moving to Arizona for a semester to solely take astronomy classes, her path unfolded to eventually lead her through a postdoc to an assistant professor position.</p>

            <p> Along the way, she excitedly mentions, she got to meet many telescopes. “You name it, I’ve probably tried to figure out a way to use it… I’ve used some of the biggest telescopes in the world.” I, of course, could not name many telescopes, but I fully believe her claim. I ask what her favorite telescope was, expecting a justification describing the optimal specs, lens and display for the perfect view. Instead, Rachel takes me on a quest through the Atacama Desert. On the coast of Chile lies the Very Large Telescope, which does, in fact, boast beautiful images of celestial wonders. The journey to get there, however, is the highlight. Two flights and a three-hour bus ride leads you to the Middle of Nowhere, Chile, where you can find a “half-buried residential complex thing” that’s straight out of a James Bond movie (literally!). While it’s all sand above surface, when you go underground, “you’re basically in this indoor rain forest with a pool.” Up the mountain lies four “incredible instruments,” blending the entire beautiful experience with knowledge…and a good amount of “strange” and “weird” that makes this place unique.</p>

            <p> Wanting to learn more about her telescopic research, I ask Rachel if she could share one fact or image with the general population, what would it be?</p>
            <p> “The supermassive black hole.” </p>

            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="images/interviews/nish.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width="70%"> </br>
              Image of the black hole by Dr. Bezanson </a>
            </div> </br>

            <p> The coolest thing about astronomy is its “ridiculous scales of sizes…that essentially force you to think outside the scope of anything that you can really comprehend.” Contrasting studies within a molecular lab to her studies of massive galaxies, Rachel details the factors of ten that encapsulate the universe, scales that are difficult to even fathom.</p>

            <p> While there are certainly more beautiful pictures to choose (the ones that “get put on leggings and whatever”) this breakthrough image of a black hole embodies the “deep understanding and intuition” that motivates Rachel’s own study of galaxies. It doesn’t look like much, but when you know that you are seeing the effects of gravity so intense that light is jailed within it, it is invaluable. And that visible light is a snapshot from history that has traveled for millions of years.</p>

            <p> This image epitomizes Dr. Bezanson’s passion and intellectual drive to astronomy that is clear through her descriptions of the universe, appealing to both scientists and the public. In this fifteen-minute glimpse into her world (and beyond!), my concept of the beauty of our universe has changed; rather than looking to a starry sky for a pretty picture, I hope to internalize the magnitude, science and journey of everything behind a simple image.</p>

             A Starry Life, an Interview with Amy Jackson
            </h5>

            <p> Sitting on her porch on the side of her home in Houston, Amy Jackson waves and smiles to me through Zoom. With the sound of her barking dogs and lively house in the background, Amy chats about how she had a love for space since her childhood just like many others who grew up near the world-renowned Houston Space Center. It was during her time at the University of Houston studying physics that she, “got to develop a relationship with the night sky.” She found a telescope observatory on top of the Science and Research 1 at the University of Houston. “It was just sitting there dead, so we formed the Cosmic Society,” Amy describes to me, “We cleaned it all up and opened it back up to the public.” </p>

            <p> That was actually one of her first experiences with using a telescope and observational astronomy she explains with wonder, “I remember camping out and seeing the Milky Way, really understanding that we’re living in it and looking through the plane of our galaxy… you can read that that is what we’re doing, but to actually experience it is fascinating”.</p>

            <p> This experience eventually catapulted Amy into starting her own business Starry Sky Austin. At the time, she was a high school science teacher, but she felt constrained by the traditional classroom format, which I think many of us can relate to. “I felt like all I wanted to do was take the kids out to have these [star-seeing] experiences and get inspired to do science.” In addition, Amy was also a mother who was struggling to find time to balance her full-time job and stay at home to take care of the kids. </p>

            <p>For Amy, Starry Sky Austin served as a vehicle to allow her to pursue her own passions of astronomy and education while also finding time for her family. Starry Sky Austin began with just teaching kids how to use a telescope at night but blossomed into doing Girl Scout programs, dark sky conservation work, public programs, and more during its 20 years.</p>

            <p> In this vein, Amy tells me that she also participates in the Globe at Night campaign, a citizen science initiative that seeks to map the extent of light pollution throughout the world by inviting anyone to take readings with their smartphones. She uses this opportunity to bond with her 8th grade daughter, who she lovingly dubs her “Research Assistant.”  The pair can be found at night traveling around the neighborhood taking readings that will help researchers and scientists gain a better understanding of the light pollution in their area.</p>

            <p> Prior to the Covid-19 lockdown, Amy was planning a graduate research project that explored how light pollution impacts the populations of Mexican free-tailed bats in Austin, which I found particularly interesting due to my background with biology. She begins by painting me a picture of Austin’s Congress Avenue Bridge. This bridge seems innocent for those driving over it, but its thousands of dark crevices underneath provide a home to the world’s largest bat population with up to 1.5 million bats swarming out from underneath it on summer nights. This unlikely phenomenon has given rise to both bat tourism and growing concerns about our human impact on this bat population.</p>

            <p> With more urban development beginning near the bridge, Amy felt that it would be vitally important for the City of Austin to know what impact they were having on the bats and take the necessary precautions to minimize light pollution both on the bridge itself and in nearby communities. However, as a result of the current ongoing epidemic, the project has been tabled for the time being due to restrictions on handling live bats.</p>
