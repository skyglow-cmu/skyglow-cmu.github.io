              Dark Skies from the Other Side of the World
            </h5>

            <p> When I interviewed Douglas Sprigg, the director of Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary in South Australia, it was early morning where I was on the East Coast of the United States. On the other side of the Earth, Mr. Sprigg was calling me after a night of observatory tours, when the darkness of the night sky was at its deepest. During the interview, he gave me a greater insight into the importance of dark skies as it relates to both the animals on his sanctuary as well as the humans that come to visit his observatories. </p>

            <p> Mr. Sprigg has had many wonderful experiences with star-filled skies, the earliest of which he remembers coming from the camping trips he took with his parents. Mr. Sprigg’s father, the previous director of Arkaroola, was a prolific geologist and scientist who would take his family on his outback travels. When he was seven years old, Mr. Sprigg was brought along on the first motorized crossing of the Simpson Desert, and he recounts “sleeping under the wonder and majesty of the celestial canopy.” He told me about how his own curiosity as a child towards the night sky is mirrored in the children that he sees on the astronomical observatory tours that he has run since 1986, and that dark skies are an essential part of nurturing scientific interest in young people, as “enquiring and challenging what we think we know is all part of science.”</p>

            <p> During our hour-long talk over FaceTime, Mr. Sprigg gave me a miniature observatory tour of my own, bringing me to a telescope in one of the four observatories open to the public at Arkaroola. Despite the poor connection and shaky video signal, he was still able to show me some beautiful images of the various celestial objects that are visible from Australia’s night sky. Through the telescope, we could see everything from Saturn and its distinctive tilted rings to the M57 Ring Nebula with its orange-red border born from nitrogen and sulfur. When I asked him about his favorite object to view in the night sky, he replied that he had a fondness for just about anything in space, and what he really loves was “seeing people suddenly get enthused about astronomy,” something that he gets to experience every time he brings someone up to the telescopes and shows them the beauty of binary stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies, and so on. As someone who has a deep love for astronomy myself, I was grateful for the opportunity to look through the telescopes, even as far away from the actual equipment as I was. </p>

            <p> Besides the up-close astronomical examination of the night sky that can be done with a telescope, there is also the overall impact of the dark sky on both humans and animals. There are many animals living in Arkaroola that would be negatively impacted by light pollution, like the yellow-footed rock wallabies, which are most active during the night. Mr. Sprigg showed me a picture of Cato, a rock wallaby that came to live with them for four months after an eagle attack, who is not only an adorable, wide-eyed, fluffy creature, but also an important reason to protect Australia’s dark skies. Where Mr. Sprigg lives, he says that he can often see stars down to magnitude 7 with the naked eye. He mentioned that the increased immigration to Australia’s urban areas, most of which are coastal, means that although the inland is more sparsely populated and light pollution is low by European and American standards, it is increasing as urban development continues. This could become problematic, as increased light pollution impacts Australia’s environment and makes it more difficult for people to enjoy the awe-inspiring and wonderful experience of clear dark skies. </p>

            <p> What I gained from this conversation was a deeper understanding of the importance of the dark skies, and how they are essential not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a communal one. Each generation’s continued love and fascination with what we can see in the night sky is essential to foster scientific growth for ages to come. </p>

              Light Pollution under the Lens: An Interview with Steven Miller
            </h5>
            

            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
              <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
            </button>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> Today I spoke with Steven Miller on Zoom. Steven is a professional photographer and dark sky advocate in the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). He started out as a photographer, then later experienced his first dark sky while on a trip to Maine. Since then, he has been fascinated with photographing the night sky. </p>

            <p> Steven told me, “In the 200 years, we have taught ourselves not to look up at the night sky.” I myself am guilty of this, as are many other people I’m sure. It’s hard to blame us, really. I would have little idea of what a completely dark sky looks like without photographs like those taken by Steven.</p>

            <p> During our interview, Steven talked about ways to improve urban lighting, giving examples in his hometown of Orlando, FL. Shielding lights was an important consideration. He also talked about the process he goes through to take his stunning dark sky photos. </p>

            <p> Although I admittedly already knew a lot of the information he gave me about light pollution, I enjoyed listening to his enthusiasm for bringing back our dark skies. He showed me that you don’t need to have deep scientific knowledge to have an appreciation of dark skies. Steven screenshared with me PowerPoints that he had used at previous IDA events. He showed examples of poorly-designed and well-designed light fixtures. </p>

            <p> Since Steven lives in a highly urbanized area, he does not focus his activism on the dark skies themselves, but rather on better urban lighting practices that can both reduce light pollution and improve public safety.  </p>

            <p> According to Steven, the IDA is “not asking us to turn off all lights,” but rather, use lighting in a responsible way that reduces light pollution. To leave a parking lot completely dark, although it improves the dark sky, would obviously be “irresponsible.” However, he emphasized multiple times that nighttime spaces can also be too brightly lit. For example, he noted drivers who forget to turn on their headlights when exiting an over-lit parking lot, which could lead to more automobile accidents. He also used an example of the glare from a brightly lit gas station: “If your eyes are adjusted to the bright light under the gas station, would you be able to see a creepy guy running towards you from the dark?” </p>

            <p> One of the first things Steven showed me during the interview was a framed long-exposure dark sky photo from Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the nearest dark sky site to Orlando. It was his first dark sky photo. </p>

            <p> I was particularly amazed by the amount of effort he put in to take his dark sky photos. Firstly, he can only go out during the new moon. High humidity can also reduce visibility of stars. He has to stay up all through the night in an isolated campsite to take photos, sleeping until noon or 2 pm the next day. The camera exposure must also last 20 to 30 seconds—if there are humans in the picture, such as a wedding couple, they must stay still the whole time. </p>

            <p> One thing that struck me was how the long exposures emphasized the impact of light pollution on the night sky. In his photo at Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the light coming from a single rest stop formed a large band of orange glow across the horizon. At the extreme, a long-exposure photo of a downtown area is a complete whitewash, the entire sky obscured by skyglow. </p>

            <p> These long-exposure photos give a graphic representation of how significant the impact of light pollution is on wildlife and human health. With the naked eye, we can’t really “see” how artificial light drowns out the night sky. We just see a blank sky. But in Steven’s long-exposure photos, we can clearly see the orange glow on the horizon, drowning out the stars. (Or blue glow, in the case of some LEDs.) </p>

            <p> What if our naked eye saw light pollution in the same way Steven Miller’s camera lens sees it? Would we as humans be more committed to stopping light pollution? </p>
