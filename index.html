              Dark Skies from the Other Side of the World
            </h5>

            <p> When I interviewed Douglas Sprigg, the director of Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary in South Australia, it was early morning where I was on the East Coast of the United States. On the other side of the Earth, Mr. Sprigg was calling me after a night of observatory tours, when the darkness of the night sky was at its deepest. During the interview, he gave me a greater insight into the importance of dark skies as it relates to both the animals on his sanctuary as well as the humans that come to visit his observatories. </p>

            <p> Mr. Sprigg has had many wonderful experiences with star-filled skies, the earliest of which he remembers coming from the camping trips he took with his parents. Mr. Sprigg’s father, the previous director of Arkaroola, was a prolific geologist and scientist who would take his family on his outback travels. When he was seven years old, Mr. Sprigg was brought along on the first motorized crossing of the Simpson Desert, and he recounts “sleeping under the wonder and majesty of the celestial canopy.” He told me about how his own curiosity as a child towards the night sky is mirrored in the children that he sees on the astronomical observatory tours that he has run since 1986, and that dark skies are an essential part of nurturing scientific interest in young people, as “enquiring and challenging what we think we know is all part of science.”</p>

            <p> During our hour-long talk over FaceTime, Mr. Sprigg gave me a miniature observatory tour of my own, bringing me to a telescope in one of the four observatories open to the public at Arkaroola. Despite the poor connection and shaky video signal, he was still able to show me some beautiful images of the various celestial objects that are visible from Australia’s night sky. Through the telescope, we could see everything from Saturn and its distinctive tilted rings to the M57 Ring Nebula with its orange-red border born from nitrogen and sulfur. When I asked him about his favorite object to view in the night sky, he replied that he had a fondness for just about anything in space, and what he really loves was “seeing people suddenly get enthused about astronomy,” something that he gets to experience every time he brings someone up to the telescopes and shows them the beauty of binary stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies, and so on. As someone who has a deep love for astronomy myself, I was grateful for the opportunity to look through the telescopes, even as far away from the actual equipment as I was. </p>

            <p> Besides the up-close astronomical examination of the night sky that can be done with a telescope, there is also the overall impact of the dark sky on both humans and animals. There are many animals living in Arkaroola that would be negatively impacted by light pollution, like the yellow-footed rock wallabies, which are most active during the night. Mr. Sprigg showed me a picture of Cato, a rock wallaby that came to live with them for four months after an eagle attack, who is not only an adorable, wide-eyed, fluffy creature, but also an important reason to protect Australia’s dark skies. Where Mr. Sprigg lives, he says that he can often see stars down to magnitude 7 with the naked eye. He mentioned that the increased immigration to Australia’s urban areas, most of which are coastal, means that although the inland is more sparsely populated and light pollution is low by European and American standards, it is increasing as urban development continues. This could become problematic, as increased light pollution impacts Australia’s environment and makes it more difficult for people to enjoy the awe-inspiring and wonderful experience of clear dark skies. </p>

            <p> What I gained from this conversation was a deeper understanding of the importance of the dark skies, and how they are essential not only from a scientific perspective, but also from a communal one. Each generation’s continued love and fascination with what we can see in the night sky is essential to foster scientific growth for ages to come. </p>

              Light Pollution under the Lens: An Interview with Steven Miller
            </h5>


            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close">
              <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
            </button>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p> Today I spoke with Steven Miller on Zoom. Steven is a professional photographer and dark sky advocate in the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). He started out as a photographer, then later experienced his first dark sky while on a trip to Maine. Since then, he has been fascinated with photographing the night sky. </p>

            <p> Steven told me, “In the 200 years, we have taught ourselves not to look up at the night sky.” I myself am guilty of this, as are many other people I’m sure. It’s hard to blame us, really. I would have little idea of what a completely dark sky looks like without photographs like those taken by Steven.</p>

            <p> During our interview, Steven talked about ways to improve urban lighting, giving examples in his hometown of Orlando, FL. Shielding lights was an important consideration. He also talked about the process he goes through to take his stunning dark sky photos. </p>

            <p> Although I admittedly already knew a lot of the information he gave me about light pollution, I enjoyed listening to his enthusiasm for bringing back our dark skies. He showed me that you don’t need to have deep scientific knowledge to have an appreciation of dark skies. Steven screenshared with me PowerPoints that he had used at previous IDA events. He showed examples of poorly-designed and well-designed light fixtures. </p>

            <p> Since Steven lives in a highly urbanized area, he does not focus his activism on the dark skies themselves, but rather on better urban lighting practices that can both reduce light pollution and improve public safety.  </p>

            <p> According to Steven, the IDA is “not asking us to turn off all lights,” but rather, use lighting in a responsible way that reduces light pollution. To leave a parking lot completely dark, although it improves the dark sky, would obviously be “irresponsible.” However, he emphasized multiple times that nighttime spaces can also be too brightly lit. For example, he noted drivers who forget to turn on their headlights when exiting an over-lit parking lot, which could lead to more automobile accidents. He also used an example of the glare from a brightly lit gas station: “If your eyes are adjusted to the bright light under the gas station, would you be able to see a creepy guy running towards you from the dark?” </p>

            <p> One of the first things Steven showed me during the interview was a framed long-exposure dark sky photo from Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the nearest dark sky site to Orlando. It was his first dark sky photo. </p>

            <p> I was particularly amazed by the amount of effort he put in to take his dark sky photos. Firstly, he can only go out during the new moon. High humidity can also reduce visibility of stars. He has to stay up all through the night in an isolated campsite to take photos, sleeping until noon or 2 pm the next day. The camera exposure must also last 20 to 30 seconds—if there are humans in the picture, such as a wedding couple, they must stay still the whole time. </p>

            <p> One thing that struck me was how the long exposures emphasized the impact of light pollution on the night sky. In his photo at Kissimmee Prairie State Park, the light coming from a single rest stop formed a large band of orange glow across the horizon. At the extreme, a long-exposure photo of a downtown area is a complete whitewash, the entire sky obscured by skyglow. </p>

            <p> These long-exposure photos give a graphic representation of how significant the impact of light pollution is on wildlife and human health. With the naked eye, we can’t really “see” how artificial light drowns out the night sky. We just see a blank sky. But in Steven’s long-exposure photos, we can clearly see the orange glow on the horizon, drowning out the stars. (Or blue glow, in the case of some LEDs.) </p>

            <p> What if our naked eye saw light pollution in the same way Steven Miller’s camera lens sees it? Would we as humans be more committed to stopping light pollution? </p>

Her work features across an array of formats, from museum exhibits at the National History Museum of Utah to publications such as National Geographic and the Los Angeles Times. This week I was lucky enough to talk to her about everything from her dream collaborator to the most pressing issues facing the IDA today. As a relative novice to the field of astronomy and dark-skies, I was really keen to talk to someone who could project a beating passion for this area and express why this was so important to them. </p>

            <p> Bettymaya developed her love for stars and dark skies from a young age. Growing up in Moab, Utah, Bettymaya spent summer nights stargazing from her trampoline.  Her passion continued throughout her academic career as she completed a degree in Environmental and Sustainability Studies. It was during this time that some of the challenges facing dark-skies truly became clear to her. After moving from the idyllic Moab to the hustle and bustle of Salt Lake City, one of the first things Bettymaya noticed was the relative blandness of the urban sky. Since then, Bettymaya has been leading the charge to raise awareness and support research to help preserve the world’s fading dark-skies.</p>

            <p> Bettymaya also gave me an insight into what inspires her work as an astrophotographer, and how despite all the world’s wonders she has already captured, she still has an insatiable appetite to discover more. I asked her to picture a helicopter appearing suddenly outside her door - if it could take her anywhere in the world, where might she go? Armed with her camera, Bettymaya told me she dreams of visiting the Himalayas to witness its Airglow, a natural phenomenon where the Earth’s atmosphere appears to emit its own faint source of light.</p>

            <p> There was a palpable sense of excitement and adventure after I asked Bettymaya who her dream collaborator would be; she replied that she would love to once more work with astrophotographer Sergio Montúfar. Together they embarked on an adventure across his native Guatemala, shooting its stunning ancient Mayan temples across a backdrop of pure dark-skies. </p>

            <p> Unfortunately for Bettymaya and the rest of the Dark-Sky community, problems like ‘Skyglow’, where the night sky is illuminated by artificial sources, are rapidly contributing to their recession. The main reasons for this, as Bettymaya explains, are the combination of increasing urban sprawl and the prevalence of poorly designed and unshielded lights. Urban sprawl is somewhat inevitable as countries’ economies grow and continue to invest in their developing cities; on the other hand, the misuse of light is a much simpler problem to solve. Streetlamps are often poorly designed and are a main contributor to Skyglow; instead of brightening only the street below, they typically bleed outwards and illuminate the sky. In theory, LEDs chould solve this problem as they can be easily directed and controlled. However, poor planning and design leads too often to more unnecessary illumination of the surrounding area. A key lesson for city planners to learn is to become aware of this and choose fully sustainable products. Bettymaya was keen to stress the need to be aware of this regardless of location; whether one is installing lights in a major city or in the middle of nowhere, this bleeding effect can have severely detrimental impacts on our surroundings. The best way to prevent this is to ensure that a light installation meets three key criteria: the light is shielded, uses warmer colors and is not too intense.</p>

            <p> Looking ahead, Bettymaya continues to strive towards raising awareness for the protection of our fleeting Dark-Skies. She proposed that one of the most effective ways to do this is to join the International Dark-Sky Association’s Advocate Network. By becoming an IDA Delegate, volunteers can become the face of the IDA in their local communities and provide a platform for them to continue spreading their impact.</p>

             Orders of Magnitude: The Significance of Astronomy through Dr. Rachel Bezanson
            </h5>

          <div class="modal-body">
            
            <p> A blanket of stars overwhelmed the sky, scattering far past the horizon. Appearing white and twinkly, they acted as a foil to the explosive trail of the Milky Way that lead to the peak of a distant mountain. This was the average night’s view from the deck of Rachel’s childhood home in “the Middle of Nowhere, Colorado.”</p>

            <p> “I probably just took it for granted,” Rachel—now Dr. Bezanson— reflects. I am interviewing Dr. Bezanson, observational astronomer at the University of Pittsburgh, over Zoom—she has just woken up while I’m across the world, already hours into the night. I peer out my own balcony doors, staring into glaring lights permeating through thousands of windows, bespeckling a blank navy umbrella above; these are the stars of Singapore’s skies.</p>

            <p> I grew up thinking pictures of real starry skies were fabricated because I simply couldn’t imagine it; it’s difficult to comprehend that Rachel had grown up able to take those pictures every night. It evokes a sense of nostalgia for something I had never experienced.</p>

            <p>“It wasn’t like I always knew I was going to be an astronomer,” Rachel continues. While night-sky visibility has significantly decreased over the years, seeing the Milky Way every night wasn’t something she thought about very much while growing up, although she did love the view. “Like, if you’re used to seeing streetlights, you just get used to streetlights.” In college, pre-med Rachel decided to take an introductory astronomy for non-majors course on a whim . . . and she fell in love. Moving to Arizona for a semester to solely take astronomy classes, her path unfolded to eventually lead her through a postdoc to an assistant professor position.</p>

            <p> Along the way, she excitedly mentions, she got to meet many telescopes. “You name it, I’ve probably tried to figure out a way to use it… I’ve used some of the biggest telescopes in the world.” I, of course, could not name many telescopes, but I fully believe her claim. I ask what her favorite telescope was, expecting a justification describing the optimal specs, lens and display for the perfect view. Instead, Rachel takes me on a quest through the Atacama Desert. On the coast of Chile lies the Very Large Telescope, which does, in fact, boast beautiful images of celestial wonders. The journey to get there, however, is the highlight. Two flights and a three-hour bus ride leads you to the Middle of Nowhere, Chile, where you can find a “half-buried residential complex thing” that’s straight out of a James Bond movie (literally!). While it’s all sand above surface, when you go underground, “you’re basically in this indoor rain forest with a pool.” Up the mountain lies four “incredible instruments,” blending the entire beautiful experience with knowledge…and a good amount of “strange” and “weird” that makes this place unique.</p>

            <p> Wanting to learn more about her telescopic research, I ask Rachel if she could share one fact or image with the general population, what would it be?</p>
            <p> “The supermassive black hole.” </p>

            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="images/interviews/nish.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" width="70%"> </br>
              Image of the black hole by Dr. Bezanson </a>
            </div> </br>

            <p> The coolest thing about astronomy is its “ridiculous scales of sizes…that essentially force you to think outside the scope of anything that you can really comprehend.” Contrasting studies within a molecular lab to her studies of massive galaxies, Rachel details the factors of ten that encapsulate the universe, scales that are difficult to even fathom.</p>

            <p> While there are certainly more beautiful pictures to choose (the ones that “get put on leggings and whatever”) this breakthrough image of a black hole embodies the “deep understanding and intuition” that motivates Rachel’s own study of galaxies. It doesn’t look like much, but when you know that you are seeing the effects of gravity so intense that light is jailed within it, it is invaluable. And that visible light is a snapshot from history that has traveled for millions of years.</p>

            <p> This image epitomizes Dr. Bezanson’s passion and intellectual drive to astronomy that is clear through her descriptions of the universe, appealing to both scientists and the public. In this fifteen-minute glimpse into her world (and beyond!), my concept of the beauty of our universe has changed; rather than looking to a starry sky for a pretty picture, I hope to internalize the magnitude, science and journey of everything behind a simple image.</p>
